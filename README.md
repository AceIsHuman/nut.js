# Installation

`nut.js` comes with a pre-built version of OpenCV for your respective target platform.
In order to use these pre-compiled bindings, certain runtime conditions have to be met.

## Prerequisites

This section lists runtime requirements for `nut.js` on the respective target platform.
`nut.js` is built and tested against node 10 and later as well as Electron 4 and later, so in order to use `nut.js` please make sure to use one of these versions.

#### Windows

In order to install `nut.js` on Windows, please make sure to have the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed.

#### macOS

On macOS, Xcode command line tools are required.
You can install them by running
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Attention**:

In case you're experiencing problems like your mouse not moving or your keyboard not typing,
please make sure to give the process you're executing your tests with accessibility permissions.

If an application wants to use accessibility features, a permission pop-up should be shown.
If not, you could try to manually add the application you're running the script from.

`Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility -> Add...`

#### Linux

Depending on your distribution, Linux setups may differ.

In general, `nut.js` requires

- libXtst

Installation on `*buntu` distributions:
```bash

### Snapshot releases

`nut.js` also provides snapshot releases which allows to test upcoming features.
